## About

Established in 2023 after a [Society for Improvement of Psychological Sciences](https://improvingpsych.org/)<!--rehype:target=_blank--> [Unconference](https://osf.io/3t7hz)<!--rehype:target=_blank-->, our task force is committed to improving the transparency of pilot study practices in psychology and related disciplines.

## Mission

Our overarching goal is to cultivate an environment where reporting pilot studies becomes an organic practice. To achieve this, we have outlined 3 concrete objectives and corresponding activities: Initiate Field-Wide Dialogue, Develop Practical Resources, Encourage Reporting Adoption.
