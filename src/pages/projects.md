## Pilot Practices Assessment Group
Examines current pilot study practices to inform future task force initiatives

Projects:
1. Survey on Piloting Practices in Psychology (_completed_)
_Leads: Isaac Handley-Miner, Jade Pickering, & Johanna Tomczak_
This project investigated how psychological researchers design and conduct pilot studies, as well as their perceptions of the value, challenges, and feasibility of transparently reporting pilot studies in publications. You can find the final report [here](/pilotingTF_technical-report2024.pdf).

2. Collection and Taxonomy of Piloting Practices in Psychology (_upcoming_)
This project will compile and categorize existing piloting approaches across psychological subfields to build an open, accessible resource bank


## Pilot Reporting Assessment Group
Determines the baseline by evaluating how pilot studies are currently reported in published research

Projects:
1. Meta-Assessment of Pilot Study Reporting in Psychology
_Lead: Agata Bochynska_
This project investigates the frequency and quality of pilot study reporting in recent psychological research. We’ll be recruiting contributors for article coding summer-fall 2025. If you're interested in getting involved, please contact [Agata](https://www.ub.uio.no/english/about/people/samdig/open-research/agatabo/) or reach out to our task force team for more information.


## Reporting Mechanism Development Team
Develops tools and templates for pilot study reporting and evaluation

Projects:
1. Developing Standalone and Manuscript Companion Templates for Transparent Pilot Study Reporting (_ongoing_)
_Lead: Mary Beth Neff_
This project began with two collaborative [hackathons](https://osf.io/vjt2x) <!--rehype:target=_blank--> at [SIPS 2024](https://www.improvingpsych.org/SIPS2024/). Since then, we produced a draft standalone pilot-reporting template as well as a manuscript companion template. Initial user testing was carried out during [SIPS 2025](https://www.improvingpsych.org/SIPS2025/), and we anticipate finalizing the timeline for public release in early 2026.


## Outreach Team
Promotes transparent pilot study practices through scholarly dissemination and partnership initiatives

Projects:
1. Scholarly Dissemination (Stage 1) (_ongoing_)
_Leads: Isaac Handley-Miner & Yashvin Seetahul_
This project focuses on communicating best practices for pilot study reporting through academic outlets (e.g., conferences, blogs, journal articles). See _Events_ and _Outputs_ pages for more up-to-date details.

2. Strategic Collaborations (Stage 2) (_upcoming_)
This project will involve partnering with online repositories and academic publishers to develop targeted implementation and adoption strategies.
