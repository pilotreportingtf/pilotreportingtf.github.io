## 1. Survey on Piloting Practices in Psychology
To gain insights into the variety of piloting practices across psychology, we are conducting a survey capturing researchers' perspectives on how they understand, approach, and conduct pilot studies.

_Project Leads:_ Jade Pickering, Johanna Tomczak, & Isaac Handley-Miner

## 2. Developing a template for transparent pilot study reporting
To kick off this project, we will lead two hackathons at [SIPS 2024](https://www.improvingpsych.org/SIPS2024/)<!--rehype:target=_blank--> (one in person and one online). We will build on insights from our 2023 SIPS [unconference](https://osf.io/3t7hz)<!--rehype:target=_blank--> and the piloting practices survey to draft a standalone reporting template for pilot studies.

_In person facilitators:_ Mary Beth Neff & Agata Bochynska

_Online facilitators:_ Isaac Handley-Miner, Hannah LÃ¶nneker, & Kai Li Chung
