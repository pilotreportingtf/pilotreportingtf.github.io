## Pilot Practices Assessment Group
<!--rehype:style=margin-bottom: 0.5rem;-->
Examines current pilot study practices to inform future task force initiatives

**1. Survey on Piloting Practices in Psychology (_completed_)**<br>
   This project investigated how psychological researchers design and conduct pilot studies, as well as their perceptions of the value, challenges, and feasibility of transparently reporting pilot studies in publications. You can find the final report [here](/pilotingTF_technical-report2024.pdf).<br>
   _Leads: Isaac Handley-Miner, Jade Pickering, & Johanna Tomczak_ 

**2. Taxonomy of Piloting Practices in Psychology (_upcoming_)**<br>
   This project will compile and categorize existing piloting approaches across psychological subfields to build an open, accessible resource bank.<br>
   _Leads: TBA_  


## Pilot Reporting Assessment Group
<!--rehype:style=margin-bottom: 0.5rem;-->
Determines the baseline by evaluating how pilot studies are currently reported in published research

**1. Meta-Assessment of Pilot Study Reporting in Psychology (_ongoing_)**<br>
   This project investigates the frequency and quality of pilot study reporting in recent psychological research. We will be recruiting contributors for article coding during summer–fall 2025. If you're interested in getting involved, please contact [Agata](https://www.ub.uio.no/english/about/people/samdig/open-research/agatabo/) or reach out to our task force team for more information.<br>
   _Leads: Agata Bochynska_  


## Reporting Mechanism Development Team
<!--rehype:style=margin-bottom: 0.5rem;-->
Develops tools and templates for pilot study reporting and evaluation

**1. Standalone and Manuscript Companion Templates (_ongoing_)**<br>
   This project began with two collaborative [hackathons](https://osf.io/vjt2x) <!--rehype:target=_blank--> at [SIPS 2024](https://www.improvingpsych.org/SIPS2024/). Following these events, we produced a draft standalone pilot-reporting template as well as a manuscript companion template. Initial user testing was carried out during [SIPS 2025](https://www.improvingpsych.org/SIPS2025/), and we anticipate finalizing the timeline for public release in early 2026.<br>
   _Leads: Mary Beth Neff_  


## Outreach Team
<!--rehype:style=margin-bottom: 0.5rem;-->
Promotes transparent pilot study practices through scholarly dissemination and partnership initiatives

**1. Stage 1: Scholarly Dissemination (_ongoing_)**<br>
   This project focuses on communicating best practices for pilot study reporting through academic outlets (e.g., conferences, blogs, and journal articles). See the _Events_ and _Outputs_ pages for more up-to-date details.<br>
   _Leads: Isaac Handley-Miner & Yashvin Seetahul_  

**2. Stage 2: Strategic Collaborations (_upcoming_)**<br>
   This project will involve partnering with online repositories and academic publishers to develop targeted implementation and adoption strategies.<br>
   _Leads: TBA_
