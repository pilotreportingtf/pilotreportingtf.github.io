## 1. Survey on Piloting Practices in Psychology (completed)
This project investigated how psychological researchers design and conduct pilot studies, as well as their perceptions of the value, challenges, and feasibility of transparently reporting pilot studies in publications. You can find the final report [here](/pilotingTF_technical-report2024.pdf).

## 2. Meta-Assessment of Pilot Study Reporting in Psychology (ongoing)
This project investigates the frequency and quality of pilot study reporting in recent psychological research. We’ll be recruiting contributors in summer 2025.

## 3. Developing Standalone and Manuscript Companion Templates for Transparent Pilot Study Reporting (ongoing)
We kicked off this project with two [hackathons](https://osf.io/vjt2x) <!--rehype:target=_blank--> at [SIPS 2024](https://www.improvingpsych.org/SIPS2024/). Since then, we’ve developed a draft standalone template and a companion template for manuscripts. We’ll be conducting user testing on both at [SIPS 2025](https://www.improvingpsych.org/SIPS2025/) so come join our session if you are interested in contributing. 

_Project Lead:_ Mary Beth Neff
